		<p>Hey everyone, I have to leave in a few minutes so I'll keep this brief.</p>
<p>When Eli and I launched the Umbra server and product over a year ago (wow, time flies) we never anticipated that our community would grow so large. As many of you know, we started out by developing a simple Roblox chat bypasser application and today we have over 50,000 premium users and we are developing Roblox's most advanced script utility. The Umbra team is also working on several crypto related projects - you've already seen Crypvault and we hope to reveal one more very soon.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that our community is incredibly large and diverse, and for its entire existence, I have been extremely personal, honest, and transparent in the server. As Im sure you've noticed I try to act like just another member in the server - I hang out in voice channels a ton and text channels too sometimes, and I have had tons of open and honest discussions about the server and product with you guys.</p>
<p><strong>We also host several debate channels on the server which is why Im writing this notice.</strong></p>
<p>Specifically, the channels in question are:</p>
<ul>
<li>#debate-politics-1</li>
<li>#debate-politics-2</li>
<li>#debate-religion</li>
<li>#debate-sexuality-gender</li>
</ul>
<p>As I stated and as many of you know I actually do spend time on the server and I understand that many of you are simply uncomfortable with having these channels in the server. I understand that, as neutral channels, while they are extremely important for gauging opinions and educating others, they do provide a platform for extremists and retards to post their stupid opinions. While we welcome these retarded ideologies and opinions, we understand that they are discomforting to some. Furthermore, most of our members come here for Roblox scripting related stuff and never actually read those channels. And lastly, I know that some members have seen these channels and decided that they do not want to purchase a product from servers that allow the type of content we do in these neutral channels. And I know I always say that I care about the community more than money but I also do love money.</p>
<p>As heavily requested, we will be moving these channels to a separate server on October 15th, 2022. Here's what'll happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Oct 10:</strong> The listed channels will be set to read-only.</li>
<li><strong>Oct 10:</strong> The new Umbra Debates server (working title lol) will be opened to the public featuring the same channels and perhaps some more.</li>
<li><strong>Oct 15:</strong> The listed channels will be deleted from the server.</li>
<li><strong>Oct 15:</strong> Because transparency is important to us, a public archive of the channels will be posted on a hidden section of the Umbra website. This will include deleted and edited messages - even messages that were deleted or edited before now. <strong>We will not edit or remove any content unless it contains personal information or breaks international law - please send deletion requests to our legal address and you will be responded to on/after Oct 10</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>As always we made this plan with YOUR (the entire server's) interests at heart and if you disagree or don't like any of the changes here - MAKE IT KNOWN. Send us an email or post it in the #feedback-sever-gen channel. And, there is nothing that will please every single person so if we notice a considerable amount of you disagree with something, we will consider changing it.</p>
<p>I also feel that it's important to note that I'm leaving for a week-long trip and I won't be responding to emails for about a week. The rest of the Umbra team will still be available to respond to emails.</p>
<p>Anyways I gotta go so I love you all. Platonically of course</p>
<p>-Dom</p>
