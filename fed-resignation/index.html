		<p><em>Public Statement from Fed</em></p>
<p><em>Former Umbra Administrator</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As many of you know, I have recently resigned from my role as administrator for Umbra. I would like to take this opportunity to explain why I am resigning.</p>
<p>There are currently several staff members who I feel do not belong. They have made the Umbra server a toxic, unwelcoming place. The server is nothing like how it was a few months ago. Despite my several calls for their removal, they are still employed here and I do not feel comfortable in the work environment they create.</p>
<p>I resigned of my own accord, without big drama. I'm just done and moving on. I do not plan on joining another community until I have the time to collect my thoughts and re-evaluate my situation.</p>
<p>Thank you for being so kind to me while I was an administrator here. I have made many memories and met many amazing people in this server.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I ask that you respect everyone involved in this situation.</p>
<p>Until next time, <strong>vivamus libero!</strong></p>
<p> - Fed</p>
